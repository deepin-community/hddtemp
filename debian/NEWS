hddtemp (0.3-beta15-54) unstable; urgency=medium

  hddtemp has been dead upstream for many years and is therefore in a minimal
  maintenance mode. It will be shipped in the Debian Bullseye release, but
  will not be present in the Debian Bookworm release.

  Nowadays the 'drivetemp' kernel module is a better alternative. It uses the
  Linux Hardware Monitoring kernel API (hwmon), so the temperature is returned
  the same way and using the same tools as other sensors.

  Loading this module is as easy as creating a file in the /etc/modules-load.d
  directory:

    echo drivetemp > /etc/modules-load.d/drivetemp.conf
